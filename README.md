# Whalebone Attention AR Installation

An interactive AR installation exploring AI attention, human gaze, and spatial memory through the metaphor of a digital whale skeleton.

## 📌 Overview

This project uses **AR technology** and **gaze-based interaction** to simulate how AI learns and mimics human attention. As users look at the whale skeleton, **AI-generated arrow particles** follow their gaze, gradually **shaping and transforming the structure**—a metaphor for how digital systems feed on attention and reshape our reality.

Inspired by the film *Whalebone*, the project reflects on themes of **digital life, collective memory, and asynchronous human-AI collaboration**.

## 🎯 Concept Highlights

- **Gaze = Power**: User gaze becomes a spatial shaping force.
- **AI = Mimetic Companion**: Arrows represent AI attention, mimicking without full understanding.
- **Memory = Trace**: Accumulated gaze reshapes space and alters user behavior.
- **Whalebone = Metaphor**: Represents time, life, and the irreversibility of digital memory.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Unity + ARKit + Holokit**: AR rendering and headset display
- **VFX Graph**: Particle system (arrow simulation using Perlin Noise + Ping-Pong effect)
- **Gaze Raycasting**: Detects intersection with mesh for attaching AI arrows
- **Holokit Stereo Rendering**: Supports immersive experience

## 🌀 Interaction Flow

1. User enters space and wears Holokit headset.
2. A giant **digital whale skeleton** appears in AR.
3. As the user gazes at parts of the skeleton:
   - **Arrow particles** follow their gaze
   - These particles **accumulate and distort** the skeleton mesh
4. The whale gradually **loses its original form**, symbolizing how AI reshapes content through human attention.

## 🧪 Exhibition & Feedback

- **Presented at**: [insert event name here]
- **User Study**: Observed behavior changes include:
  - Increased stillness, extended gaze duration
  - Path deviation (users walking around the skeleton)
  - Reflective commentary on attention and AI presence
